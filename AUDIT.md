## How to Read This Document

Each issue has a unique ID (`A-XXX`), severity, status, and affected files.
Issues are grouped by category. New findings are appended as they are discovered.

---

## Section 1: Harness Correctness Issues

### A-001 [CRITICAL] Reference and Submission Model Are the Same Object

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
def _load_models(weights_path: Path):
    sub_model, sub_tokenizer = _load_participant_model(str(weights_path))
    ...
    return sub_model, sub_tokenizer, sub_model  # ref == sub!
```

The local correctness gate compares `ref_model` against `sub_model`. Since they are
the same Python object, all three correctness layers pass unconditionally. A
participant whose transform corrupts every hidden state by +0.1 would pass local
testing and only fail on submission to the server. This gives participants false
confidence and makes local iteration useless for correctness debugging.

**Fix required**: Load a separate reference model from a baseline snapshot of
`mlx_models/` (as proposed in SPEC.md §12 option a). The reference must not use
the participant's modified code path.

---

### A-002 [HIGH] Peak RAM Measurement Not Properly Isolated

**Status**: FIXED (2195db9) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
# Warmup
cache = model.make_cache()...
_ = model(prompt, cache=cache)
mx.eval(model.parameters())

# Reset peak memory counter before measuring decode.
mx.reset_peak_memory()
```

The warmup forward pass allocates: slot bank tensors, KV cache buffers, stacked
expert tensors, attention matrices. `mx.reset_peak_memory()` is called AFTER
warmup. If the warmup allocations are the peak (which they often are — the slot
bank and KV cache fully allocate during prefill), then `peak_ram_gb` = warmup
peak, not decode peak.

**Additionally**: The prefill measurement runs after decode and reuses the slot
bank state. The peak RAM measurement captures decode, but decode may reuse
warmup-allocated buffers without allocating new memory, reporting an
artificially low peak.

**Fix required**: `mx.reset_peak_memory()` should be called before ANY model
execution, then read after prefill (for prefill peak) and reset+read again for
decode peak.

---

### A-003 [HIGH] Correctness Steps Hardcoded to 64 (Spec Says 256)

**Status**: FIXED (765ba92) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/correctness.py`

```python
CORRECTNESS_STEPS = 64
```

The CHALLENGE.md and SPEC.md both specify 256 autoregressive steps for the
greedy token sequence check. The comment says "64 is sufficient" but a transform
that produces correct tokens for 64 steps but diverges at step 200 passes the
local harness and only fails on the server. This makes local correctness
testing unreliable for long-sequence behavior.

**Fix required**: Either match to 256 steps (matching the spec) or document the
discrepancy and justify why 64 is sufficient.

---

### A-004 [MEDIUM] Prefill Latency Measured After Decode — Cache Contamination

**Status**: FIXED (635a191) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
decode_spt, peak_gb, mactop_session = _measure_latency_and_memory(...)
prefill_spt = _measure_prefill_latency(sub_model, prefill_prompt)
```

The decode loop runs first, populating the slot bank with up to 128 expert
records. Then prefill runs — but it REUSES the slot bank. Experts that were
loaded during decode are already in Metal memory, so the prefill pays fewer
disk reads. This means:

- Prefill latency is **artificially lowered** (fewer disk reads)
- The score is **unfairly good** compared to a fresh-start prefill
- The ordering hides the true cost of cold-start prefill

**Fix required**: Run prefill BEFORE decode, or clear the slot bank between
phases.

---

### A-005 [MEDIUM] No Hidden State From All Three Correctness Layers

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/correctness.py`

The three correctness layers are:
1. Greedy token sequence match (implemented)
2. Hidden state tolerance (implemented)
3. Top-10 logit set match (implemented)

However, the hidden states in Layer 2 are taken from `hidden_states[-1]` which
is the **final hidden state** (post-norm, pre-lm_head). This does NOT capture
intermediate layer hidden states. The SPEC §4.2 specifies capturing at "each of
the 43 layer boundaries", but the implementation only checks the final output.

A transform that corrupts layer 5 but fixes it by layer 20 would pass the
final hidden state check while having bad intermediate representations.

**Fix required**: Either capture per-layer hidden states from the model (requires
model changes to return intermediate states) or document that only the final
hidden state is checked locally.

---

## Section 2: Anti-Cheat & Verification Issues

### A-006 [HIGH] Harness Hash Not Pinned — Tamper Detection Disabled

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/constants.py`, `mlxfast/_self_hash.py`

```python
EXPECTED_HARNESS_HASH = os.environ.get("MLXFAST_EXPECTED_HARNESS_HASH", "")
```

```python
def verify() -> None:
    ...
    if not expected:
        return  # ← returns immediately, NO check performed
```

With no pinned expected hash (empty string by default), the harness tamper
detection is completely disabled. Participants can modify any harness file
without detection. The `_self_hash.verify()` returns immediately doing nothing.

**Fix required**: Set `EXPECTED_HARNESS_HASH` to a real pinned value at build
time. The env var override should be for dev only.

---

### A-007 [HIGH] No Architecture Invariant Check

**Status**: FIXED (d1047f0) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

SPEC §6.3 specifies:
```python
FROZEN_CONFIG_FIELDS = ["model_type", "num_hidden_layers", "hidden_size",
                        "n_routed_experts", "num_experts_per_tok", ...]
```

This check is **not implemented** anywhere in the harness. A participant could
change `n_routed_experts` from 256 to 64, reducing the effective model size
by 4× without changing any model code. The harness would accept this and
report a dramatically better score.

**Fix required**: Add a config validation function that checks all frozen fields
match the reference exactly, called in `run()` before model loading.

---

### A-008 [MEDIUM] Weight Provenance Not Verified (No-Transform Path)

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

SPEC §6.1 specifies content-hash comparison between `weights/` and the
expected hash from `transform.py`. When `transform.py` exists, the sandbox
re-run verifies determinism. But when `transform.py` does NOT exist (pure
inference-only improvements), there is **no verification** that `weights/`
matches the reference. A participant could replace weights with a smaller
or different checkpoint and the harness wouldn't detect it.

**Fix required**: When no `transform.py` exists, compute a SHA-256 of the
`weights/` directory and compare against a pinned reference hash.

---

### A-009 [MEDIUM] Sandbox Read Whitelist Includes Participant's CWD

**Status**: FIXED (c5104cd) | **Files**: `mlxfast/_sandbox.py`

```python
for _sp in sys.path:
    if _sp and _sp != ".":
        _candidate = Path(_sp).resolve()
        if _candidate.is_dir():
            _ALLOWED_READ_ROOTS.add(_candidate)
```

The participant's working directory (cwd) is added to `sys.path` during normal
Python execution. The sandbox explicitly filters "." but if cwd resolves to an
absolute path already in `sys.path`, it becomes an allowed read root. This
means any `.py` file in the working directory could influence the transform
output — breaking the determinism guarantee.

**Fix required**: Explicitly exclude the cwd (not just ".") and any paths that
contain it from `_ALLOWED_READ_ROOTS`.

---

### A-010 [LOW] Sandbox Time Blocking Too Broad

**Status**: FIXED (6e1e4f4) | **Files**: `mlxfast/_sandbox.py`

```python
class _FrozenAttr:
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        sys.stderr.write(f"BLOCKED: time.{name} access\n")
        sys.exit(3)
    def __call__(self, *a, **kw):
        sys.stderr.write("BLOCKED: time() call\n")
        sys.exit(3)
```

This blocks ALL attribute access on the `time` module. But `time.sleep` is
harmless for determinism (wall time doesn't affect output). Some libraries
(including numpy and mlx) use `time.perf_counter` internally for performance
logging. The sandbox will crash if numpy's internal timer fires during
transform execution.

**Fix required**: Only block functions that could influence output (e.g.,
`time.time` for seeding RNGs). Allow harmless timers.

---

## Section 3: Model Implementation Issues

### A-011 [MEDIUM] Slot Bank Reads Are Synchronous — No I/O Overlap

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlx_models/mlx_lm_shims/switch_layers.py`

```python
records = [bank.get(self._layer_idx, e) for e in unique]
```

Each cache miss calls `os.pread()` which blocks the calling thread. For 6
activated experts per layer × 43 layers = 258 blocking disk reads per decode
step. At ~50-200μs per pread, this adds 13-50ms of disk wait per token.
The CHALLENGE.md correctly identifies "no async I/O" as a gap, but the
baseline should be understood as **intentionally crippled** — no production
system would decode with blocking I/O like this.

**Impact**: The baseline decode latency is dominated by disk wait, not GPU
compute. A prefetching implementation could see 2-5× decode speedup without
any GPU changes.

---

### A-012 [MEDIUM] Cross-Layer Prefetch Metadata Wired But Dead

**Status**: FIXED (43ab323) | **Files**: `mlx_models/deepseek_v4/deepseek_v4.py`

```python
for i, (layer_idx, switch) in enumerate(moe_layers):
    if i + 1 < len(moe_layers):
        switch._next_moe_layer_idx = moe_layers[i + 1][0]
```

`StreamingSwitchGLU` never references `_next_moe_layer_idx`. The metadata is
wired but has no consumer. Dead code that could confuse participants.

---

### A-013 [MEDIUM] Global `mx.clear_cache()` in Prefill Causes Fragile Behavior

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlx_models/mlx_lm_shims/switch_layers.py`

```python
if N > 1:
    mx.eval(result)
    del gate_w, gate_s, ...
    mx.clear_cache()  # ← global clear
```

`mx.clear_cache()` releases ALL Metal allocations back to the OS. If any
computation graph in subsequent layers references tensors from earlier layers,
the next `mx.eval()` will fault. This is a fragile workaround for the prefill
memory explosion problem. A better approach would be targeted deallocation
or using a streaming pipeline that doesn't accumulate all 43 layers'
intermediate tensors.

**Risk**: With speculative decoding or changed execution order, this `clear_cache`
could silently corrupt results or crash with obscure Metal errors.

---

### A-014 [MEDIUM] `sorted(set(tolist()))` Creates CPU-GPU Sync Point Per Layer

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlx_models/mlx_lm_shims/switch_layers.py`

```python
unique: list[int] = sorted(set(sorted_idx.tolist()))
```

`tolist()` on a GPU tensor forces a CPU-GPU synchronization. This happens for
every forward pass of every layer. For 43 layers × 512 decode steps = 22,016
sync points. Each sync costs ~5-10μs on Apple Silicon = ~110-220ms total
overhead. This is a deliberate baseline choice, but it should be documented.

**Optimization hint**: Unique experts can be computed on-GPU using `mx.unique`,
avoiding the sync entirely. But `mx.unique` returns GPU tensors that need
CPU-indexing for the slot bank lookup.

---

### A-015 [LOW] Shared Expert Quantization Config Written But Not Applied

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlx_models/deepseek_v4/language.py`

```python
def make_quantization_config(model):
    ...
    shared_experts = {k: mxfp8 for k, _ in flat_modules if ".ffn.shared_experts." in k}
    return {
        "group_size": 64, "bits": 8, "mode": "affine",
        **experts, **shared_experts, **attn,
    }
```

`make_quantization_config` returns a dict mapping module paths to quant configs.
But this dict is only used by `quant_predicate` which determines WHETHER to
quantize, not HOW. The actual quantization is baked into the loaded checkpoint
weights. Shared experts in the checkpoint are loaded as `QuantizedLinear(mxfp8)`,
but `DeepseekV4MLP` creates `nn.Linear` (non-quantized). The mismatch means
shared expert weights are loaded as quantized tensors but processed through
non-quantized linear layers — **this would produce incorrect results**.

The local harness doesn't catch this because ref == sub (A-001).

---

## Section 4: Bandwidth Measurement Issues

### A-016 [HIGH] Mactop Idle Baseline Not Subtracted

**Status**: FIXED (4944368) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/bandwidth.py`

SPEC §5 specifies:
```python
baseline_bw = measure_idle_dram_bw(duration=3s)  # before model loads
...
net_bw_gbs = [max(s - baseline_bw, 0) for s in samples]
```

This idle baseline measurement is **not implemented**. The code directly
uses mactop sample values without subtracting the background DRAM traffic.
On a machine with ~2 GB/s background DRAM activity (display, kernel tasks,
background processes), this adds ~50 GB to the total for a 25-second decode
run, inflating bandwidth by 15-30%.

**Fix required**: Add an idle bandwidth measurement phase before model loading,
and subtract it from decode samples.

---

### A-017 [MEDIUM] Software Bandwidth Model (Fallback) Is Inaccurate

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/bandwidth.py`

```python
def _moe_software_estimate(model, experts_manifest_path, num_tokens):
    leaves = tree_flatten(model.parameters())
    non_expert_bytes = sum(arr.nbytes for _, arr in leaves)
    expert_bytes = NUM_EXPERTS_PER_TOK * record_size * NUM_HIDDEN_LAYERS
    total_bytes = non_expert_bytes + expert_bytes
    gb_per_token = total_bytes / (1024 ** 3)
```

This model:
1. **Does not include KV cache bytes** read during decode (can be 100s of MB per token for long contexts)
2. **Does not include activation tensor traffic** (attention scores, gate logits, residuals)
3. **Assumes every token reads exactly `NUM_EXPERTS_PER_TOK` experts** — doesn't account for cache hits in the slot bank
4. **Double-counts?** `model.parameters()` includes the unquantized weight tensors in `StreamingSwitchGLU` which are never actually used (the real weights come from the slot bank)
5. **Returns the same value regardless of optimization** — any improvement in expert caching or KV compression is invisible

Since most results.tsv entries use `moe_software_model`, the bandwidth values
in the leaderboard are meaningless for comparisons.

---

### A-018 [LOW] Mactop Zero-Filtering Can Mask Real Low-Bandwidth Windows

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/bandwidth.py`

```python
if bw > 0.0:
    samples.append(float(bw))
```

Mactop occasionally returns `dram_bw_combined_gbs = 0` as a calibration
artifact. The current code filters ALL zero values. If a decode window
happens to have zero DRAM traffic (e.g., cache hit on all weights), the
filter would remove it, inflating the mean bandwidth.

**Better approach**: Filter only isolated zero samples while keeping runs of
zeros (which might indicate real idle periods). Or use the running median
instead of mean.

---

## Section 5: Speculative Decoding Issues

### A-019 [MEDIUM] Speculative Decoding Not Normalized in Scoring

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

SPEC §6.7 specifies that speculative decoding submissions must normalize:
- `draft_tokens_per_step` (measured average)
- Raw `wall_clock_time / 512_accepted_tokens` as the score input

The harness does NOT normalize. It always runs 512 decode steps regardless of
how many tokens per step the model produces. If a participant uses MTP with
3 tokens per forward pass, the harness measures ~171 actual forward passes
for 512 reported tokens, getting an unfairly good bandwidth and latency score.

**Fix required**: Detect speculative decoding (check for `_speculative_verify`
method), count accepted tokens vs. draft steps, and normalize both bandwidth
and latency by accepted tokens.

---

## Section 6: CLI & Deployment Issues

### A-020 [HIGH] Wrong Model Name in CLI Help Text

**Status**: FIXED (f23d05d) | **Files**: `mlxfast/cli.py`

```python
@app.command()
def weights(...):
    """Download the reference Gemma 4 26B 4-bit weights.

    Downloads mlx-community/gemma-4-26B-A4B-it-qat-4bit to
    mlxfast/reference_weights/. This is a one-time ~18 GB download.
```

This references **Gemma 4**, not **DeepSeek V4 Flash**. The actual model in
`constants.py` and the transform script is `mlx-community/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit`.
A participant following these instructions would download 18 GB of wrong
weights.

---

### A-021 [MEDIUM] mlx Version Pin Mismatch

**Status**: FIXED (6e0d9f4) | **Files**: `pyproject.toml` vs `mlxfast/harness/constants.py`

```toml
# pyproject.toml
mlx==0.31.1
```

```python
# constants.py
MLX_VERSION = "0.31.2"
```

`pyproject.toml` pins `mlx==0.31.1` while the harness expects `0.31.2`.
The `mlx-lm>=0.31.2` constraint will pull mlx>=0.31.2 as a transitive
dependency, overriding the pin. But on first install with `--no-deps` or
in certain pip resolution order, the wrong version could be installed.

---

### A-022 [MEDIUM] No Baseline Published — No Calibration Point

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `CHALLENGE.md`, `README.md`

All baseline metrics show "TBD" — no actual baseline has been measured.
Without a published baseline:
- Participants cannot know if their optimization is an improvement
- The scoring formula has no reference frame
- The leaderboard has no initial entry point

**Fix required**: Run the baseline on the reference M5 Max hardware and
publish the metrics before launch.

---

### A-023 [LOW] Submission Infrastructure Is a Stub

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/cli.py`

`mlxfast submit` only prints JSON to stdout when `MLXFAST_API_URL` is unset.
The server endpoint is not built. `mlxfast login` stores credentials to disk
but never uses them. The challenge cannot accept real submissions.

---

## Section 7: Ongoing Discovery Loop

> New findings are appended below as they are discovered. Each discovery cycle
> re-examines files previously read with fresh perspective, looking for patterns
> missed in earlier passes.

---

### Cycle 1: Deep-Dive Into harness/bandwidth.py

**Re-examining**: `mlxfast/harness/bandwidth.py` — all functions

#### A-024 [MEDIUM] ~~Mactop Decode Duration Uses Pre-Computed Value, Not Real Elapsed~~

```python
total_gb = mean_gbps * decode_duration
```

Where `decode_duration` is passed from `run.py`:
```python
decode_duration=decode_spt * constants.DECODE_LENGTH
```

This uses the **mean** decode_spt computed from wall clock, not the actual
elapsed time that mactop was running. If the decode loop has timing variance
(e.g., first token slower due to cache misses), the duration used for
bandwidth calculation doesn't match the actual mactop sample window.

**Fix required**: Pass the actual `elapsed` time from `_measure_latency_and_memory`
instead of computing from mean decode_spt.

**Status**: FIXED (90e3f00) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`, `mlxfast/harness/bandwidth.py`

#### A-025 [LOW] Mactop Session State Duplicated

```python
class MactopSession:
    def stop(self) -> List[float]:
        ...
        self._samples = samples  # ← stores in instance

    def __exit__(self, *_):
        self._samples = self.stop()  # ← stores again
```

Then in `_mactop_result`:
```python
samples = session._samples  # reads from instance
```

The `stop()` method both returns samples AND sets `self._samples`. The
`__exit__` method sets it again (redundantly). But `run.py` does:
```python
mactop._samples = mactop.stop()  # manual set after stop()
```

This is fine but confusing — three different code paths that converge on the
same attribute. A simpler design would be to have `stop()` only return and
let the caller assign.

**Status**: FIXED (c4df16f) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/bandwidth.py`

---

### Cycle 2: Deep-Dive Into transform.py

**Re-examining**: `transform.py` — full pass 2

#### A-026 [MEDIUM] Transform.py Opens All Safetensors Files Simultaneously

```python
handles: dict[str, safe_open] = {}
for shard_name in needed_shards:
    handles[shard_name] = safe_open(str(model_dir / shard_name), framework="numpy")
```

For the DeepSeek V4 Flash checkpoint (~33 safetensor shards), this opens 33
file handles simultaneously. Each `safe_open` maps the file into memory
(mmap). On a 24 GB machine, mapping multiple multi-GB shards simultaneously
can trigger swap or OOM. The handles are kept open while iterating all 43
layers × 256 experts.

**Fix required**: Open/close shards on demand rather than holding all 33
simultaneously. The bottleneck is disk I/O, not file handle overhead.

#### A-027 [LOW] Fallback Stacked Format Handles Only Weight, Not Scales/Biases

```python
# Stacked format: all experts in one tensor (axis 0 = expert index).
stacked_keys[(layer, proj, ttype)] = (shard, key)
```

The stacked-key detection looks for `".ffn.switch_mlp."` in the key name.
But in the stacked format, scales and biases may have different key patterns
(e.g., `.switch_mlp.gate_proj.scales` vs `.switch_mlp.gate_proj.weight`).
If the scales tensor is per-expert (not stacked) while the weight is stacked,
the code may miss the scales entry and fail to find it later.

---

### Cycle 3: Deep-Dive Into correctness.py

#### A-028 [MEDIUM] Epsilon Applied to Post-Norm Hidden States Can Amplify Errors

```python
h_diff = float(mx.max(mx.abs(ref_hidden - sub_hidden)))
```

The hidden states being compared are the **output of RMSNorm** (applied in
`DeepseekV4Model`'s forward before returning). RMSNorm divides by the RMS of
the input. If `ref_hidden = norm(x)` and `sub_hidden = norm(x + δ)`, the
difference `|norm(x) - norm(x + δ)|` can be larger than `|δ|` because norm(x)
and norm(x + δ) have different normalization constants.

For x with small RMS (e.g., after a layer with small activations), even a
small δ can produce a large post-norm difference. The 5e-3 epsilon may be
too tight for layers with small activation norms and too loose for large ones.

**Fix required**: Compare pre-norm hidden states, or use a relative error
metric (`|a-b| / max(|a|, |b|, 1e-8)`) instead of absolute.

#### A-029 [LOW] Top-K Logit Set Uses argpartition — May Not Be Deterministic

```python
ref_topk = set(mx.argpartition(-ref_logits, kth=CORRECTNESS_TOP_K - 1)
               [:CORRECTNESS_TOP_K].tolist())
```

`argpartition` on GPU may produce non-deterministic results for equal logits
(the partition is stable in theory but GPU parallelism can reorder equal
elements). If two tokens have identical logits (common after softmax with
low-temperature greedy), the top-K set comparison may spuriously fail due
to ordering within equal elements.

**Fix required**: Use `mx.topk` which is documented as stable, or sort within
the top-K set before comparing.

**Status**: FIXED (e150e45) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/correctness.py`

---

### Cycle 4: Deep-Dive Into cache.py

#### A-030 [MEDIUM] PoolingCache.accumulate_windows Has Off-by-One in Decode Mode

```python
# Decode mode
else:
    self.buf_kv[:, self.remainder : self.remainder + 1] = kv
    self.buf_gate[:, self.remainder : self.remainder + 1] = gate
    self.remainder = (self.remainder + 1) % self.ratio
```

When `remainder == 0` and `ratio == 4`, after the update `remainder = 1`.
The code accumulates 1 token per decode step and when `remainder` wraps to 0
(4 tokens accumulated), it returns the full buffer as `r_kv`. But the buffer
assignment `self.buf_kv[:, self.remainder : self.remainder + 1]` writes to
index [remainder, remainder+1). When `remainder` is, say, 3, it writes to
index 3 (the 4th position). The next step wraps to 0. **This is correct**.

However, in prompt mode:
```python
self.buf_kv[:, self.remainder : new_remainder] = kv[:, -new_remainder:]
```

When `new_remainder < self.remainder` (e.g., remainder=3, new_remainder=2),
this writes to the first 2 positions. But it should write to the **last**
`new_remainder` positions (the tail of the input). The code writes to
`self.remainder : new_remainder` which when remainder=3 and new_remainder=2
creates a slice `3:2` which is **empty**. The tail tokens are silently
discarded.

#### A-031 [LOW] RotatingKVCache Offset Type Confusion

```python
self.offset += incoming  # offset can be int or mx.array
```

In `DeepseekV4Block`, `position_offset` is passed as:
```python
offset = mx.array(offset) if isinstance(offset, mx.array) else offset
```

But `RotatingKVCache.update_and_fetch` increments `self.offset` which starts
as `0` (Python int). After adding an `mx.array`, it becomes an `mx.array`.
This causes subsequent comparisons like `if cache.offset > max_size:` to
return an mx.array instead of bool, which can fail in conditional contexts.

---

### Cycle 5: Deep-Dive Into mla.py and QuantizedMultiLinear

#### A-032 [LOW] QuantizedMultiLinear Initializes With Random Weights Then Freezes

```python
def __init__(self, input_dims, output_dims, num_heads, group_size, bits, mode):
    weight = mx.random.uniform(...)
    self.weight, self.scales, *biases = mx.quantize(weight, group_size, bits, mode=mode)
    self.freeze()
```

This creates random weights at init time, quantizes them, then freezes the
module. These random weights are **never used** — they're overwritten during
`load_weights`. But the initialization is not a no-op: it allocates GPU
memory, runs quantize kernel, and freezes — all wasted work. The freeze step
prevents subsequent `load_weights` from assigning new values if the module's
`__setattr__` checks for frozen state.

**Fix required**: Initialize with empty/none weights and only allocate during
`load_weights`.

---

### Cycle 6: Deep-Dive Into the Pipeline / Distributed Code Paths

#### A-033 [LOW] PipelineMixin Cuts Layers But Leaves None Entries

```python
class PipelineMixin:
    @property
    def pipeline_layers(self):
        return self.layers[self.start_idx : self.end_idx]
```

In `DeepseekV4Model.__init__`:
```python
self.layers = [DeepseekV4Block(config, idx) for idx in range(config.num_hidden_layers)]
```

When `pipeline()` is called:
```python
self.layers[: self.start_idx] = [None] * self.start_idx
```

The layers before `start_idx` are replaced with `None`. The `pipeline_layers`
property slices from `start_idx` to `end_idx`, skipping the Nones. But
`cache` is still `[None] * len(self.pipeline_layers)` when cache is None,
then `zip(self.pipeline_layers, cache)` pairs each pipeline layer with a
cache entry. For non-pipeline usage (the challenge), `pipeline_size = 1` and
`start_idx = 0`, so this code path is never exercised. But it's dead code
that could confuse participants maintaining the model.

### Cycle 7: Integrity of Score Computation

#### A-034 [LOW] Score Multiplies Four Quantities With Incompatible Precisions

```python
score = peak_ram_gb * bandwidth_gb_per_token * decode_sec_per_token * prefill_sec_per_token
```

`peak_ram_gb` has ~0.001 GB precision (∼1 MB), `bandwidth_gb_per_token` has
~0.000001 precision, decode/prefill have sub-ms precision. The product spans
many orders of magnitude. A tiny change in peak_ram (say 7.5058 → 7.5059 GB,
a 0.0013% change) multiplied by the other terms can produce a score change
of ~0.00003, which is below the reported precision (6 decimal places).

**Not a bug**, but worth noting that the score is dominated by bandwidth ×
decode_latency (typically ∼5-10) while peak_ram × prefill contributes ∼0.3-0.5.
Optimizing only peak RAM has diminishing returns on the score.

---

### Cycle 8: Deep-Dive Into hyper_connection.py Metal Kernel

#### A-035 [LOW] Fused Metal Kernel Has Hardcoded Threadgroup Size of 256

```python
grid=(B * L * 256, 1, 1),
threadgroup=(256, 1, 1),
```

The `hc_sinkhorn_collapse` kernel uses a threadgroup of 256 threads,
hardcoded. On M5 Max with 32-core GPU, each core has a limited threadgroup
size. The kernel assigns lane 0-31 for sinkhorn (simd group 0) and all 256
threads for the collapse phase. On future GPUs with different threadgroup
limitations, this could be suboptimal or fail to compile.

#### A-036 [LOW] bfloat4 Loading Assumes 4-Byte Alignment

```python
float4 v = (*(const device float4*)(mix + BASE_OFF + llane * HC) ...
```

The `float4` load from `mix` assumes 16-byte alignment. If `mix` is not
16-byte aligned (due to the `BASE_OFF` offset), this is undefined behavior
in Metal. In practice, Metal's device memory allocation is 16-byte aligned,
and `BASE_OFF = 2 * HC` with HC=4 gives 8 floats = 32 bytes, so it's aligned.
But this is fragile — changing HC breaks it silently.

---

### Cycle 9: Deep-Dive Into the Weight Expert File Format

#### A-037 [LOW] Manifest Stores Per-Tensor Metadata But Never Validates on Read

```python
def _load(self, layer_idx, expert_idx):
    manifest = self._manifest
    record_size: int = manifest["record_size"]
    offset: int = expert_idx * record_size
    data: bytes = os.pread(fd, record_size, offset)
```

The manifest stores `dtype`, `shape`, `nbytes`, `offset_in_record` for every
tensor. But `_load` never validates that the read data matches the expected
tensor shapes/dtypes. If the manifest is modified by a participant to
report smaller shapes (to reduce recorded bandwidth), the slot bank would
read truncated data and pass it to gather_qmm. The correctness gate might
still catch this (wrong hidden states), but it's a potential attack vector
for the software bandwidth model (which reads `record_size` from the manifest).

---

### Cycle 10: Environment & Configuration

#### A-038 [LOW] `benchmark.sh` References `benchmark_contract.py` Which May Not Exist

```bash
BENCHMARK_HELPER="tools/benchmark_contract.py"
...
wanted_hash="$("${PYTHON}" "${BENCHMARK_HELPER}" source-hash)"
```

If `tools/benchmark_contract.py` is missing or doesn't have a `source-hash`
subcommand, the benchmark script fails with an opaque error. The file exists
but its contract is undocumented.

---

### Cycle 11: Deep-Dive Into _force_sanitize_load and Model Loading

#### A-039 [MEDIUM] Frozen Field `intermediate_size` Does Not Exist in Reference Config

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `SPEC.md`, `mlxfast/harness/constants.py`

SPEC §6.3 lists `intermediate_size` as a frozen config field. But the
reference `config.json` for DeepSeek V4 Flash does NOT contain
`intermediate_size` — it only has `moe_intermediate_size`. The
architecture invariant check (which isn't implemented yet per A-007)
would fail on a field that doesn't exist in the reference checkpoint.

```python
FROZEN_CONFIG_FIELDS = [
    ..., "intermediate_size", ...  # ← DOES NOT EXIST in reference config.json
]
```

The `ModelConfig` dataclass has `intermediate_size: int = 18432` as a
default, but the actual checkpoint doesn't set it. If the invariant check
is added later, it must handle missing fields with a default fallback.

---

### Cycle 12: Deep-Dive Into Monkey-Patching and Global State

#### A-040 [MEDIUM] `_force_sanitize_load` Globally Patches safetensors.safe_open

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
_vu.safetensors.safe_open = _SafeOpenNoFormatMeta
# ... later ...
_vu.safetensors.safe_open = _orig_safe_open
```

The monkey-patch replaces `safetensors.safe_open` (via `mlx_vlm.utils`)
with a wrapper that strips `format: mlx` metadata. This patch is global —
any code that calls `safe_open` during the model loading window gets the
patched version. This includes:
- Tokenizer loading (reads tokenizer config from safetensors)
- The participant's `transform.py` (if called in-process instead of
  in a subprocess)
- Any library that internally reads safetensors files

If the tokenizer fails to load because of the patched metadata stripping,
the error is hard to debug.

**Fix required**: Only patch the specific `safe_open` call used by
`mlx_vlm.load`, not the global import.

---

### Cycle 13: Deep-Dive Into Seed Generation and Cryptography

#### A-041 [LOW] Seed Generation Truncates to 32 Bits — Weak Entropy

**Status**: FIXED (e7fad1f) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
def hashlib_sha256(s: str) -> int:
    import hashlib
    return int.from_bytes(hashlib.sha256(s.encode()).digest()[:4], "big")

seed = int(hashlib_sha256(f"{secret}|{commit}")) % (2**31)
```

The SHA-256 hash is truncated to only 4 bytes (32 bits), then further
truncated to 31 bits via `% (2**31)`. This gives only ~2.1 billion
possible seeds. For a correctness evaluation that should be
unpredictable, 31 bits is weak — a participant could brute-force all
2.1 billion seeds offline and find one where their submission passes.

**Impact**: A participant with knowledge of their commit hash could
pre-compute which seed will be used, then optimize for that specific
prompt set rather than general correctness.

**Fix required**: Use at least 64 bits of hash, ideally the full
SHA-256 output to seed `numpy.random.SeedSequence`.

---

### Cycle 14: Deep-Dive Into Sandbox Security

#### A-042 [MEDIUM] Sandbox Audit Hook Does Not Block os.pread/os.pwrite

**Status**: FIXED (d35e954) | **Files**: `mlxfast/_sandbox.py`

The audit hook monitors `open`, `socket.connect`, `subprocess.Popen`,
etc. But it does NOT monitor:
- `os.pread` / `os.pwrite` — low-level I/O that bypasses the `open` event
- `mmap` — memory-mapped file access bypasses `open` events
- `os.sendfile` — can read/write files outside the audit system

A transform.py that opens files via `os.open` (as the baseline does)
and then uses `os.pread` would be caught by the `open` event check.
But if transform.py uses `mmap` to map a file from an unexpected path,
the audit hook sees only the `mmap` event (which is also not monitored).

**Fix required**: Add audit events for `os.pread`, `os.pwrite`, `mmap`,
and any other I/O-related events.

#### A-043 [LOW] Ctypes Handles Loaded Before Hook Are Still Usable

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/_sandbox.py`

```python
elif event == "ctypes.dlopen":
    sys.stderr.write(f"BLOCKED: ctypes.dlopen(...)\n")
    sys.exit(3)
```

The hook blocks NEW ctypes library loads via `dlopen`. But any native
library that was loaded BEFORE the hook was installed (e.g., during
`import numpy` or `import mlx`) retains its function pointers and can
still call arbitrary C code. These pre-loaded libraries are in Python's
`ctypes` internal cache and `dlopen` is not called again for them.

A participant could exploit this by importing a malicious Python
package that uses ctypes to load a native extension during import
(before the sandbox hook is installed), then calling functions from
that extension inside transform.py.

**Fix required**: This is partially mitigated by the `open` audit event
(any file read outside allowed paths is blocked), but memory-only
exploits (e.g., sending data over a file descriptor inherited from the
parent process) are still possible.

---

### Cycle 15: Deep-Dive Into sys.modules Manipulation

#### A-044 [MEDIUM] sys.modules Swap Is Not Thread-Safe or Re-entrant

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
_orig = sys.modules.get("mlx_vlm.models.deepseek_v4")
sys.modules["mlx_vlm.models.deepseek_v4"] = participant_mod
try:
    model, tokenizer = _force_sanitize_load(
        lambda: mlx_vlm.load(weights_path, trust_remote_code=False)
    )
finally:
    sys.modules["mlx_vlm.models.deepseek_v4"] = _orig
```

The harness temporarily replaces `mlx_vlm.models.deepseek_v4` in
`sys.modules` with the participant's module. During model loading, any
import of this module path will get the participant's version. This
includes:
1. The tokenizer processor (`processing_deepseek_v4.py`) which is
   imported during model loading
2. Any cross-references from other model modules
3. The MTP speculative drafter loading

If the participant's module has side effects during import (file reads,
network calls), those run inside the harness.

**Fix required**: Use a proper shadow import mechanism (importlib
meta_path finder) instead of temporarily replacing sys.modules entries.

---

### Cycle 16: Deep-Dive Into Error Handling and Exception Masking

#### A-045 [MEDIUM] _SafeOpenNoFormatMeta.__exit__ Passes Exceptions to Inner Context Manager

**Status**: FIXED (9404990) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
def __exit__(self, *args):
    return self._f.__exit__(*args)
```

The `*args` passes the exception type, value, and traceback from the
outer `with` block to the inner safetensors context manager. If the
inner `__exit__` returns a truthy value, it **suppresses the exception**.
`safetensors.safe_open.__exit__` does not suppress exceptions by default,
but this forwarding pattern means that if the outer context encounters
an error, the inner context manager's `__exit__` is called with the
exception info — which is unusual and could mask errors if the inner
implementation ever changes.

**Fix required**: Use `self._f.__exit__(None, None, None)` to keep
the original exception suppression behavior independent of the wrapping.

---

### Cycle 17: Deep-Dive Into Harness Integrity

#### A-046 [MEDIUM] CLI Files Are Not Included in Harness Hash

**Status**: FIXED (ddb688c) | **Files**: `mlxfast/_self_hash.py`, `mlxfast/harness/constants.py`

```python
def harness_root() -> Path:
    return _harness_dir().parent  # mlxfast/

def compute_harness_hash() -> str:
    h = hashlib.sha256()
    h.update(f"mlx={MLX_VERSION}\nmlx-lm>={MLX_LM_MIN_VERSION}\n".encode())
    for path in sorted(_harness_dir().rglob("*.py")):
        h.update(path.read_bytes())
    return h.hexdigest()
```

`_harness_dir()` returns `mlxfast/harness/` — this only hashes files
UNDER the `harness/` subdirectory. The CLI itself (`cli.py`),
`_harness_runner.py`, `_sandbox.py`, and `_self_hash.py` are NOT
included in the hash. A participant who modifies:
- `cli.py` to always report `passed_correctness=True`
- `_harness_runner.py` to inject fake metrics
- `_sandbox.py` to disable provenance checks
- `_self_hash.py` to always verify() as passing

Would bypass ALL harness integrity checks.

**Fix required**: Include ALL `.py` files under the `mlxfast/` package
in the harness hash, not just `harness/`.

---

### Cycle 18: Deep-Dive Into CI and Access Control

#### A-047 [LOW] CI Modifiable Surface Check Only Covers Directory Level

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `.github/scripts/enforce-modifiable-surface.sh`

```bash
alowed="$(git show "${BASE_SHA}:benchmark.json" \
  | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print("\n".join(json.load(sys.stdin)["editablePaths"]))')"
```

The CI enforcement checks that changed files are inside `["transform.py",
"mlx_models"]`. This is a coarse check — it allows changes to ANY file
under `mlx_models/`, including files that participants should NOT be
allowed to modify (if there were any). The SPEC's more nuanced list of
modifiable files (cache.py is modifiable, processing_deepseek_v4.py is
frozen) is NOT enforced at the CI level.

Currently all files under `mlx_models/` are indeed modifiable by design,
so this coarse check works. But if a new frozen file is added to
`mlx_models/` in the future, the CI would not catch it.

---

### Cycle 19: Deep-Dive Into Weight Format and Record Structure

#### A-048 [INFO] Expert Weights Are 147 GB Total — 141 GB on Disk, 4 GB in Metal

**Status**: OBSERVATION | **Files**: `weights/experts/manifest.json`

Per manifest inspection:
- `record_size`: 13,369,344 bytes (≈13.4 MB per expert)
- Per layer: 256 experts × 13.4 MB = 3.4 GB
- Total: 43 layers × 3.4 GB = **147.2 GB of expert weights**

The transformed dense-only safetensors are ~4 GB (non-expert weights).
The loader processes 6 activated experts per token × 13.4 MB = ~80 MB
loaded per layer, ~3.4 GB total per decode step (6 × 43 layers).

Each record has 6 tensors (3 projections × 2 tensors each = weight + scales,
no biases in mxfp4 mode).

---

### Cycle 20: Deep-Dive Into Quantization Configuration

#### A-049 [LOW] Quantization Config Has 644 Entries, Most Mapping to Default mxfp4

**Status**: OBSERVATION | **Files**: `weights/config.json`

The reference config.json has a `quantization` dict with 644 entries —
one per layer × per projection for each of experts, shared experts,
and attention modules. Every entry is either `mxfp4` (for experts) or
`mxfp8` (for shared experts and attention). The default at the top
level is `{"group_size": 64, "bits": 8, "mode": "affine"}` which is
OVERRIDDEN for every specific module.

The `make_quantization_config()` function in `language.py` reconstructs
this dict dynamically from the model's leaf modules. This is redundant
with the config.json data and could get out of sync if the model
architecture changes.

---

### Cycle 21: Deep-Dive Into Attention Sinks and TurboQuant Compatibility

#### A-050 [HIGH] TurboQuant KVCache Is Incompatible With Attention Sinks — Crashes on Forward

**Status**: FIXED (0cabb61) | **Files**: `mlx_models/base.py`, `mlx_models/turboquant.py`

```python
def scaled_dot_product_attention(...):
    if isinstance(cache, TurboQuantKVCache):
        if sinks is not None:
            raise ValueError("TurboQuant KV cache does not support attention sinks.")
```

The DeepSeek V4 model uses attention sinks (`attn_sink`) in every attention
layer. The sinks are initialized as `mx.zeros((n_heads,), dtype=mx.float32)`
and passed to `scaled_dot_product_attention`. Since `mx.zeros(...)` is not
`None`, the TurboQuant KV cache raises `ValueError` on every forward pass.

**Impact**: TurboQuant is completely unusable with the DeepSeek V4 model
without also patching `scaled_dot_product_attention` in `mlx_models/base.py`
to skip the sinks check when they are all-zero.

**Fix required**: Either check for all-zero sinks before raising, or initialize
`attn_sink` as `None` when the checkpoint doesn't provide non-zero values.

#### A-051 [MEDIUM] BatchTurboQuantKVCache Path Silently Drops Attention Sinks

**Status**: FIXED (68709ea) | **Files**: `mlx_models/base.py`

```python
if isinstance(cache, BatchTurboQuantKVCache):
    dequantized_keys, dequantized_values = cache.dequantize(keys, values)
    return mx.fast.scaled_dot_product_attention(
        queries,
        dequantized_keys.astype(queries.dtype),
        dequantized_values.astype(queries.dtype),
        scale=scale,
        mask=mask,
        # ← sinks is NOT passed here!
    )
```

Unlike the main path (which passes `sinks=sinks`), the `BatchTurboQuantKVCache`
path calls `mx.fast.scaled_dot_product_attention` WITHOUT the `sinks` parameter.
Attention sinks are silently dropped. If the checkpoint has non-zero sink
values, this produces incorrect attention outputs.

**Impact**: Models using `BatchTurboQuantKVCache` produce different attention
outputs than the reference, potentially failing the correctness gate with no
obvious cause.

---

### Cycle 22: Deep-Dive Into Forward Pass Mask Handling

#### A-052 [MEDIUM] Attention Mask Created From Single hc_mult Slice May Be Wrong for Layers

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlx_models/deepseek_v4/language.py`

```python
mask = create_attention_mask(
    h[:, :, 0, :],  # ← only uses hc_mult=0 slice
    mask_cache,
    window_size=self.args.sliding_window,
    return_array=True,
)
```

The mask is created from only the first `hc_mult` slice of the hidden state
(`h[:, :, 0, :]`). The `create_attention_mask` function uses the mask shape
from this input. The resulting mask is then passed to all 43 layers. But
layers with different compression ratios may have different KV cache lengths:
- Layers with `compress_ratio=0` (LocalAttention) have only local KV cache
- Layers with `compress_ratio=4` or `128` have local KV cache + pooled cache

Each layer's attention module adjusts the mask via `_align_local_mask()` and
`_extend_mask()`, which should handle the shape differences. But the mask
was originally created for the LOCAL cache only (from `mask_cache`), not for
the pooled cache. The pooled cache mask is created separately in each layer
via `pool_cache.make_mask()`. This is correct in principle.

**However**: During prefill, `_extend_mask` is called with `N = kv.shape[2]`
which is the total KV length (local + pooled). The original mask only covers
the local part. The pooled mask is appended. But if the local cache length
differs between layers (e.g., layer 0 has LocalAttention with a different
cache size than layer 1 with SparseCompressedAttention), the mask is
incorrect because it was created from layer 0's cache state but applied to
all layers.

**Impact**: Layers with different cache states than layer 0 get incorrectly
shaped masks. This could cause incorrect masking or crashes during prefill
when cache states diverge.

---

### Cycle 23: Deep-Dive Into Triangular Scoring and Decode Phase Interactions

#### A-053 [LOW] Decode Timing Includes MX Argmax Operation

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
t0 = time.perf_counter()
next_tok = mx.argmax(model(prompt, cache=cache).logits[0, -1:], axis=-1, keepdims=True)
mx.eval(next_tok)
for _ in range(num_tokens - 1):
    out = model(next_tok, cache=cache)
    next_tok = mx.argmax(out.logits[0, -1:], axis=-1, keepdims=True)
mx.eval(next_tok)
elapsed = time.perf_counter() - t0
```

The timing includes `mx.argmax` — the sampling step. This adds ~5-20μs per
token (negligible). But the FIRST token's timing is inside the timer while
the WARMUP token's timing is outside. Since the first decode token often
has additional overhead (first cache write, kernel compilation dispatch),
the timing is slightly inflated compared to ideal steady-state.

**Not a bug**, but worth documenting that the first token's overhead is
included in the average.

---

### Cycle 24: Deep-Dive Into MultiLinear and QuantizedMultiLinear Module Initialization

#### A-054 [OBSOLETE] MultiLinear/QuantizedMultiLinear Weight Loading Analysis

**Status**: RESOLVED — NOT A BUG | **Files**: `mlx_models/mlx_lm_shims/mla.py`

Upon investigation, `nn.Module.__setattr__` in MLX does NOT check the
frozen state — it simply stores array values in the module's internal dict.
The `freeze()` method only adds parameter names to `_no_grad`, which
prevents gradient computation but does NOT block weight assignment.

Additionally, `nn.quantize` replaces `MultiLinear` with `QuantizedMultiLinear`
via `model.update_modules()` (reference replacement), not via `__setattr__`.
The new `QuantizedMultiLinear` has its weights set correctly by
`MultiLinear.to_quantized()` which quantizes the original weight and stores
it in the new instance.

**Verdict**: Weight loading works correctly despite the random initialization
and freeze call in `QuantizedMultiLinear.__init__`. The random initialization
is wasteful (allocates GPU memory and runs a quantize kernel that's immediately
discarded) but doesn't affect correctness.

---

### Cycle 25: Deep-Dive Into HyperConnection Metal Kernel

#### A-056 [LOW] _hc_kernel With Unsupported Dtype Falls Back to _hc_ops But Fails Gracefully

**Status**: FIXED (0427ff1) | **Files**: `mlx_models/deepseek_v4/hyper_connection.py`

```python
use_ops = (
    self.training
    or mx.default_device() != mx.gpu
    or not mx.metal.is_available()
)
hc_func = _hc_ops if use_ops else _hc_kernel
```

The fallback from the fused Metal kernel to pure MLX ops happens when
Metal is unavailable or the device is not GPU. But the kernel also requires
specific dtype support (float16 or bfloat16 for `x`). If the model uses a
dtype that the kernel doesn't support (e.g., float32 activations), the
kernel could produce incorrect results silently. The `_hc_ops` path handles
all dtypes correctly because it uses `mx.sigmoid`, `mx.softmax`, etc. which
support any float dtype.

**Impact**: Not a bug currently, but if a participant changes the model dtype,
the Metal kernel path would silently produce wrong results while the ops path
would be correct.

**Fix required**: Add dtype checking in the kernel dispatch logic.

---

### Cycle 26: Deep-Dive Into Decode Timing and Lazy Evaluation Chain

#### A-057 [MEDIUM] Decode Loop Builds Lazy Computation Chain Across All 512 Steps

**Status**: FIXED (b6ee942) | **Files**: `mlxfast/harness/run.py`

```python
for _ in range(num_tokens - 1):
    out = model(next_tok, cache=cache)
    next_tok = mx.argmax(out.logits[0, -1:], axis=-1, keepdims=True)
mx.eval(next_tok)  # ← evaluates entire 512-step chain at once
```

If `mx.argmax` returns a lazy tensor (which it does in MLX), each iteration
builds a lazy computation that depends on the previous step's lazy result.
The cache's in-place updates (`self.keys[..., idx, :] = new_keys`) are
eager (they execute immediately), but the logits computation for each step
is not evaluated until the final `mx.eval(next_tok)`.

This means:
1. The DAG of lazy operations grows to 512 nodes, consuming GPU memory for
the computation graph (intermediate tensors that haven't been freed yet)
2. The final `mx.eval` must traverse all 512 steps sequentially, which could
cause a long pause at the end of the decode loop
3. If any intermediate step encounters an error (OOM, shape mismatch), it
only surfaces at the final `mx.eval`, making debugging difficult

**Impact**: The computation graph for the full 512-token decode sequence is
built as one lazy DAG. For a 43-layer model with ~13 MLP operations per
layer (3× gather_qmm), this is ~550 operations per step × 512 steps ≈ 280K
lazy operations waiting for the final `mx.eval`. Memory for intermediate
tensors may exceed Metal capacity.

**Fix required**: Add `mx.eval(next_tok)` inside the loop (after each
`mx.argmax`) to break the lazy chain and force per-step evaluation.

---

### Cycle 27: Deep-Dive Into Attention Mask for Pooling Cache

#### A-058 [LOW] PoolingCache.make_mask Returns None During Decode Creating No Mask

**Status**: OPEN | **Files**: `mlx_models/cache.py`

```python
def make_mask(self, L: int = 1, offset: int = 0):
    if self.pooled is None or L == 1:
        return None
```

During decode (`L == 1`), `PoolingCache.make_mask` returns `None`. This
means the compressed attention layers (`SparseCompressedAttention` and
`CompressedAttention`) receive `None` for the pooled mask during decode.

In `CompressedAttention.__call__`:
```python
pooled_mask = None
if pooled.shape[1] > 0:
    pooled_mask = pool_cache.make_mask(L, offset) if pool_cache is not None else None
    kv = mx.concatenate([kv, pooled[:, None]], axis=2)
mask = _extend_mask(mask, pooled_mask, kv.shape[2])
```

Since `pooled_mask` is `None`, `_extend_mask` creates an all-True (fully
visible) mask for the pooled positions:
```python
if pool_mask is None:
    pool_mask = mx.ones((B, H, L, N - S), dtype=mx.bool_)
```

This means during decode, ALL pooled KV positions are visible to the query,
not just the causal ones. For the first few decode steps (when offset < ratio),
this might give the query access to future pooled tokens that shouldn't be
visible yet.

**Impact**: The attention mask for pooled tokens during the first decode steps
(0 to ratio-1) is too permissive, attending to tokens that haven't been
computed yet. This is a minor numerical difference that likely doesn't affect
correctness (pooled tokens are weighted averages, so attending to a zero
initialized pool position adds nothing), but it's technically incorrect.

---

### Cycle 28: Deep-Dive Into Model Eval and Training Mode

#### A-059 [INFO] HyperConnection Uses Different Code Paths for Train vs Eval

**Status**: OBSERVATION | **Files**: `mlx_models/deepseek_v4/hyper_connection.py`

```python
def __call__(self, x: mx.array):
    use_ops = (
        self.training
        or mx.default_device() != mx.gpu
        or not mx.metal.is_available()
    )
    hc_func = _hc_ops if use_ops else _hc_kernel
    return hc_func(x, y, mixes, self.scale, self.base, ...)
```

In eval mode (which the harness sets via `model.eval()`), the fused Metal
kernel is used if available. In training mode, the pure MLX ops path is used.
The two paths should be numerically identical, but:
- The Metal kernel uses `metal::fast::exp` (lower precision)
- The ops path uses `mx.sigmoid` and `mx.softmax` with `precise=True`

This means running in training mode produces slightly different HyperConnection
outputs than eval mode. The difference is well within the 5e-3 epsilon.

---

### Cycle 29: Deep-Dive Into Result Reporting

#### A-060 [LOW] Score JSON Contains "inf" String for Failed Runs Without Proper Type

**Status**: FIXED (beb4c7d) | **Files**: `mlxfast/cli.py`

```python
def _write_score_json(report: dict, score_path: Path) -> None:
    score = _finite_float(report.get("score"))
    passed = report.get("passed", "0") in ("1", True, "true", "True")
    if not passed or score is None:
        return  # ← silently skips writing score.json
```

For failed runs, no `score.json` is written. The `benchmark.sh` script
checks for `score.json` existence with `if [[ ! -s "${SCORE_PATH}" ]]` and
reports an error if the file is missing. But a failing submission produces
NO output file, making it impossible to distinguish between a harness error
and a correctness failure from the CI output alone.

**Fix required**: Write the score.json with `"score": "inf"` for failed runs,
not skip writing entirely.

## Section 6: Transform Performance Issues

### A-100 [CRITICAL] Transform Pass 3 Reads Each Stacked Tensor 256× From Disk

**Status**: FIXED | **Files**: `transform.py`

#### Root Cause

The reference checkpoint (`mlx-community/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-4bit`) stores all 256
experts per layer as **stacked tensors** — a single tensor of shape `(256, D, K)`
per projection per layer. The transform detects this format and correctly builds
`expert_keys` mapping each `(layer, expert, proj, ttype)` → `(shard, key)`, where
the same `key` is shared by all 256 experts in a layer.

However, Pass 3's write loop reads the stacked tensor from disk **once per
expert** via `handles[shard].get_tensor(key)`, which loads the full 1.07 GB
stacked tensor every time — then slices `arr[expert_idx]` for just one
4.19 MB slice:

```python
# OLD (broken): 256 reads of same 1.07 GB tensor per layer/proj/ttype
for expert_idx in range(n_experts):
    ...
    arr = handles[shard].get_tensor(key)     # ← 1.07 GB read from disk
    if key in _STACKED_KEYS:
        arr = arr[expert_idx]                 # ← keeps 4.19 MB, discards rest
```

#### Impact — I/O Volume

| Metric | Before fix | After fix | Speedup |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Tensor reads from disk | 66,048 | 258 | **256×** |
| Data transferred (weights) | ~138.5 GB × 256 = **35.5 TB** | **138.5 GB** | **256×** |
| Data transferred (scales) | ~8.7 GB × 256 = **2.2 TB** | **8.7 GB** | **256×** |
| Total I/O (Pass 3) | **~37.7 TB** | **~147 GB** | **256×** |

#### Why This Takes 30 Minutes in CI

The CI uses **Blacksmith sticky disks** (Ceph-backed network volumes) for the
141 GB reference weights. Network filesystems have:
- **High latency per random read**: ~1–10 ms per `pread` syscall
- **No page cache warmth**: Each CI run starts cold
- **No read-ahead benefits**: 66k random seeks defeat sequential prefetch

At 66,048 random reads of 1 GB+ tensors over Ceph, each taking hundreds of
milliseconds to seek + transfer, the runtime balloons. Estimated:
- **Before fix**: 30–45 minutes for Pass 3 alone
- **After fix**: 1–3 minutes (43 layers × 6 tensor reads + sequential output)

#### Fix Applied

The fix caches each stacked tensor in memory once per layer before the expert
loop, then slices from the cached array:

```python
# NEW: read each stacked tensor once per layer, cache, slice in memory
stacked_cache: dict[str, np.ndarray] = {}
if _STACKED_KEYS:
    for (l, e, proj, ttype), (shard_name, key) in expert_keys.items():
        if l != layer_idx or e != 0:
            continue
        if key not in stacked_cache:
            arr = handles[shard_name].get_tensor(key)
            if ttype == "weight" and arr.dtype == np.uint8:
                arr = arr.view(np.uint32)
            stacked_cache[key] = arr

for expert_idx in range(n_experts):
    ...
    if key in stacked_cache:
        arr = stacked_cache[key][expert_idx]   # ← zero-copy slice
    else:
        arr = handles[shard].get_tensor(key)   # ← per-expert format only
```

#### Memory Cost

The cache holds up to 6 stacked tensors per layer (~6 × 1.14 GB = ~6.8 GB peak
for weights + scales, freed after each layer). This is well within the 32 GB+
RAM available on the CI runner and local machines.

### A-101 [MEDIUM] Pass 2 Manifest Computation Opens/Closes 6 Separate safetensor Handles

**Status**: OPEN (low priority) | **Files**: `transform.py`

Pass 2 reads layer-0 expert-0 shapes to build the manifest. It opens and closes
a new `safe_open` handle for each of the 6 stacked tensors:

```python
for ttype in ("weight", "scales", "biases"):
    ...
    with safe_open(str(model_dir / shard_name), framework="numpy") as f:
        arr = f.get_tensor(key)
    if key in _STACKED_KEYS:
        arr = arr[0]
```

This means 6 separate file opens + header parses for metadata that could be
extracted from the already-loaded `_all_keys_by_shard()` index.json weight map.
The safetensors index already contains shapes and dtypes for every key — the
manifest could be computed entirely from metadata without loading any tensor
data.

**Impact**: ≈6 extra file opens + header parses (≈50 ms each on Ceph = ~300 ms
total). Negligible for the overall 3-minute runtime after the A-100 fix.

**Fix direction**: Store tensor metadata (shapes, dtypes) during `_all_keys_by_shard()`
and use it in Pass 2 instead of re-reading tensors from disk.

### A-102 [INFO] Pass 4 Dense-Only Shard Writing Loads from All 33 Shards

**Status**: OPEN (low priority) | **Files**: `transform.py`

Pass 4 uses `mx.load(str(src))` for each of the 33 source shard files to
load only dense (non-expert) tensors. `mx.load` is lazy — it reads the
safetensor header (≈100 KB) and creates deferred tensors; only accessed
keys are materialized. This is fine.

However, because all 33 shard files contain some expert tensors (expert tensors
are spread across every shard), every shard must be opened and header-parsed,
even if it has few dense keys. Shard `model-00033-of-00033.safetensors` has
only 26 keys total.

**Impact**: 33 header reads = negligible (≈3 seconds total).

---

### A-103 [INFO] Transform Output Size: ~280 GB Written to Weights Disk

**Status**: OPEN (note only) | **Files**: `transform.py`

The baseline transform writes:
- **43 × layer_NN.bin**: ~284 MB each = **~12.2 GB** total (expert weight records)
- **33 × model-NNNNN-of-00033.safetensors**: dense shards (no expert keys),
  approximately same total size as the dense portion of the reference checkpoint:
  **~119 GB** (151 GB total − ~32 GB for stacked experts)
- **Config, tokenizer, manifest, index**: <10 MB

Total output: **~131 GB** written to the `weights/` sticky disk.

At ~1 GB/s Ceph sequential write throughput, this takes ≈2 minutes for the
dense shard copy and ≈12 seconds for the binary expert files. This is a
one-time cost per branch (cached by benchmark.sh via source hash).

**Note**: The dense shard writing (Pass 4) copies ~119 GB of data. This is the
largest single contributor to total transform time after the A-100 fix.
Optimization ideas:
- Use hardlinks/copy-on-write instead of full copy for unmodified shards
- Only rewrite shards whose dense keys actually changed (unlikely in practice)
- Stream expert-split shards directly without full dense copy
