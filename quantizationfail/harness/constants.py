"""Pinned versions, model paths, harness identity. FROZEN.

This file is the source of truth for what versions the harness was
designed against. The CLI verifies the harness's own content hash
against an expected value at startup, so any modification here will
cause `quantizationfail run` to refuse to run (a soft safety check —
the real one is the server's re-computation).

When the model or mlx-lm version is bumped, the harness hash changes
and participants see a clear error. Bump the EXPECTED_HARNESS_HASH
placeholder to a real value once the harness is server-signed.
