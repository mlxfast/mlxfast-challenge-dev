"""Harness tamper detection. FROZEN.

The CLI runs this on every `quantizationfail run` to verify that
the installed harness matches the hash the server expects. If a
participant has modified any file in `quantizationfail/`, the hash
will not match and the CLI refuses to run.

For local development, the hash check is bypassed by setting
QUANTIZATIONFAIL_SKIP_HASH_CHECK=1 in the environment. The leaderboard
submission path NEVER sets this.
