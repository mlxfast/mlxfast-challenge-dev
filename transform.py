"""transform.py — identity pass-through. PARTICIPANT REPLACES.

This is the offline weight transform. It runs ONCE, produces the
participant's `weights/` directory from `reference_weights/`, and
is then content-hashed by the harness for provenance.

The baseline version below is a no-op: it copies the reference
weights to weights/ unchanged. A submission with this transform
will get the same score as the published baseline.

Replace `main()` with your actual transform. Constraints enforced
by the harness sandbox:

  - Only reads from `inferencefail/reference_weights/`
  - Only writes to `weights/`
  - No network, no subprocess, no env reads, no clock reads
  - Same inputs must produce byte-equal output (re-verified on
    every `quantizationfail run`)

The harness discovers the model architecture from
`reference_weights/gemma-4-26b-it-4bit/config.json` (passed
through into `weights/config.json` with `model_file` pointing
back at the participant's modifiable model.py).
