"""Harness subprocess runner.

The harness (`mlxfast run`) executes the actual model
loading and measurement in a clean subprocess. The subprocess:

  - Has a fresh Python interpreter, so the global `mlx.nn.Linear`
    patch from a previous run doesn't leak.
  - Has its own `getrusage`-tracked peak RSS, so the peak RAM
    measurement reflects the harness's footprint and not the CLI's.
  - Imports the harness from the installed location (verified by
    hash), not from the participant's repo.

This module is the bridge: the CLI calls `run_in_subprocess`,
which spawns a fresh Python that imports `mlxfast.harness.run`
and calls `run(weights, note, secret)`. The result is returned as
JSON via stdout.
