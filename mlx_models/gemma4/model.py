"""Model class: attention, MoE routing, layer definitions. MODIFIABLE.

This is the top-level Model class. The harness loads it via mlx-lm's
`model_file` config escape hatch: config.json in weights/ has
`"model_file": "../mlx_models/gemma4/model.py"`, and mlx-lm imports
this file directly when constructing the model.

What you can change:
  - The Model class itself: layer count, attention pattern, MoE
    activation, etc. The harness reads num_hidden_layers,
    hidden_size, num_experts, moe_intermediate_size, etc. from
    config.json and passes them to ModelArgs. ModelArgs is defined
    here and should match what config.json provides.
  - The Attention/DecoderLayer classes: if you want a custom
    attention pattern (e.g., per-layer Hadamard) or a different
    decoder structure, redefine them here.
  - The sanitize function: how raw safetensors are mapped onto
    model parameters. Default: pass-through to upstream.

What you should NOT change:
  - The class names. config.json expects "Model" and "ModelArgs"
    attributes on this module (the standard mlx-lm model_file
    contract).
