"""Weight loading and layout. MODIFIABLE.

The harness calls `load_weights(model, weights_path)` from this
module to populate the model from the participant's `weights/`
directory. transform.py produced those safetensors.

What you can change:
  - load_weights: how safetensors are read and mapped onto the
    model. The default uses mlx.core.load to read all .safetensors
    files in weights_path and calls model.load_weights().
  - The sanitize function: weight key remapping. Default delegates
    to mlx_models.gemma4.model.sanitize.
  - Add custom pre-processing: if transform.py produced a sidecar
    file (e.g., a permutation table, a basis matrix), load it here
    and stash it on the model.

What you should NOT change:
  - The function name `load_weights`. The harness imports it by name.

Baseline behavior: load every .safetensors in weights_path, apply
the standard sanitize, populate the model.
